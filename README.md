# Vogelle Etah - Data Analyst Portfolio
# About
Hi, Vogelle here! I am a Data Analyst with a background in Mathematics and Statistics from the University of Connecticut and currently looking to obtain a degree in Data Science (MS. Data Science). I have developed a strong foundation in statistical methods and have a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science.

With over 3 years experience as a Data Analyst and currently working at Amazon Inc., I have honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in innovative techniques for data management and statistical analysis through the use of cloud-based resources and AI, which have been valuable assets in my current role and I believe will continue to propel my analytical aptitude even further. 

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.
